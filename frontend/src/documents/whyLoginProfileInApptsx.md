Redux Thunk:

Why I need to call setloginprofile in app.tsx?
-Bcz Redux state is only in- memory. It gets wiped on page reload.

‚ùóRedux does not persist state by default.
When you refresh the browser:
    ‚Ä¢ The whole React app re-initializes
    ‚Ä¢ Redux store resets to initial state (loginProfile: null)
    ‚Ä¢ Any authenticated user info is lost
Even though you saved it earlier to sessionStorage in your slice reducer:
window.sessionStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify(action.payload));
That‚Äôs just browser storage ‚Äî Redux has no idea it‚Äôs there unless you explicitly read it back in.
‚úÖ That‚Äôs Why You Use setLoginProfile in App.tsx
This effect:
useEffect(() => {
  const storedUser = sessionStorage.getItem('userProfile');
  if (storedUser) {
    dispatch(setLoginProfile(JSON.parse(storedUser)));
  }
}, []);

Does this:
    ‚Ä¢ Reads from sessionStorage
    ‚Ä¢ Writes it back into Redux
    ‚Ä¢ Makes your app "remember" that the user was logged in after refresh
üîÅ Without this:
    ‚Ä¢ auth.loginProfile is null on page load
    ‚Ä¢ The navigation will think the user is not logged in
    ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll lose login state in all components relying on Redux

e and simple.
